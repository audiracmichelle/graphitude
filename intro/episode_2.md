**Introduces the three properties which make graph databases loved by the developer community and big companies like eBay - intuitiveness, speed, and agility.**

**Discusses six key use cases for graph databases, including real-time recommendations and network+IT ops.**

There are 3 goals developers look to meet when evaluation databases:

+ **Intuitiveness** GDBs make it possible for whiteboard nodes to be represented on disk in the exact same way.  Also, Cypher is a declarative intuitive query language.
+ **Speed** graphs representation translate directly to performance advantages in GDBs.
+ **Agility** graphs adapts to real world, hence Neo4j is schema optional.

Use cases:

+ **Recommendation systems** retailers
+ **Master data management** bring together all entities within an organization, sales teams, help desk, self-service capabilities
+ **Fraud rings detection** Gorka Sadowksi, index free adjacency, real time connected analysis, banks, insurance, government, micro-currency transactions
+ **Graph based search** Neo4j founders challenge 2000 for a content mgmt system
+ **Asset mgmt application** entertainment system
+ **Network and IT operations** dependency operations analysis, root cause analysis
